Steps followed & difficulties incountered

1. started by writing and drawing a small sketch of how the application is going to work and what functionalities it has
2- created the project and installed material ui
3- followed the atomic design pattern to create my folders 
(I'm not sure if I arranged them correctly and wasn't sure what should be in the feature page)
4- wrote the atomic components till i got to the template components

I had a problem with the id uniqueness;
first i was fetching the length of the tasks array and adding 1, but if an item was deleted that would cause problem
so i started fetching the id of the last element and adding 1, however if there was no task in the array that would cause a problem
so i made sure if the array is empty the id would be 1
